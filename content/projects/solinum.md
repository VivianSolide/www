# Solinum

Thanks to [Zenika Brest](https://zenika.com/en-US/agency/brest), my new job, I had the chance to work as a volunteer for [Solinum](https://www.solinum.org/) via a [Vendredi](https://en.vendredi.cc/) partnership.

The job was pretty straightforward, to setup an open-source tracking analytics solutions called [PostHog](https://posthog.com/).
